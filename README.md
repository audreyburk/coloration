# Coloration

[Coloration](https://coloration-cimn.onrender.com/) is a palette creator for Metanet Software's amazing platformer, [N++](https://store.steampowered.com/app/230270/N_NPLUSPLUS/).

It is built with React, Vite, and a touch of TypeScript. [Render](https://render.com/) hooks into GitHub and automatically builds and deploys updates.

Development is trivial; install the packages with `yarn` and run `yarn dev` to get it up and running.

Massive thank you to Eddy for building the [original palette creator](https://github.com/edelkas/npc-web/). All of the .tga handling and half of the sprites are courtesy of his incredible work.
